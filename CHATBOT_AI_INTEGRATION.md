## ü§ñ **How the AI Chatbot Works**

### **Request Flow:**

1. **User sends message** ‚Üí `/api/chatbot/message`
2. **System fetches user data:**
   - User role (customer, vendor, admin)
   - User bookings
   - Available services
3. **Builds context-aware prompt:**
   - System context (platform info)
   - Role-specific context
   - User data context
   - User's question
4. **Google AI generates response:**
   - Uses Gemini Pro model
   - Context-aware and personalized
   - Professional yet friendly
5. **Returns response** with AI flag

### **Fallback System:**

If Google AI fails:
- ‚úÖ Automatically uses pattern-based chatbot
- ‚úÖ No error shown to user
- ‚úÖ Seamless experience
- ‚úÖ Still provides helpful responses

## üí¨ **Example Conversations**

### **Customer Example:**

**User:** "How do I book a plumber?"

**AI Response:**
```
To book a plumber on HomeServe Pro:

1. Click "Book Service" in your dashboard
2. Select "Plumbing" from the available services
3. Fill in your address and preferred date/time
4. Add any special instructions
5. Click "Confirm Booking"

A qualified plumber will be assigned to your booking, and you'll receive a notification with their details. Would you like me to help you with anything else?
```

### **Vendor Example:**

**User:** "How do I accept a job?"

**AI Response:**
```
To accept a job:

1. Go to "My Jobs" in your dashboard
2. Look for jobs with "Pending" status
3. Click the "Accept" button on the job you want
4. Once accepted, you can start the job when ready

After accepting, the customer will be notified, and the job will move to your "Accepted" list. You can then click "Start Job" when you're ready to begin work.
```

### **Admin Example:**

**User:** "How many users do we have?"

**AI Response:**
```
Based on the current data, the platform has:
- Total Users: 5 registered users
- Active Vendors: 1
- Recent Bookings: Check the bookings section for details

You can view detailed user management in the "Users" section of your admin dashboard. Would you like help with any specific user management tasks?
```

## üîç **Troubleshooting**

### **If AI responses don't work:**

The system automatically falls back to pattern-based responses. Check:

1. **API Key is set:**
   ```bash
   grep GOOGLE_API_KEY .env
   ```
   Should show: `GOOGLE_API_KEY=AIzaSyBqV1eo06HUUkxW2R5rpzEJbmm0og9C98M`

2. **Package is installed:**
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip show google-generativeai
   ```

3. **Server logs:**
   - Look for: "‚úÖ Google AI Chatbot initialized successfully"
   - Or: "‚ö†Ô∏è Google AI not available, using pattern-based responses"

### **Current Status:**

Based on server logs, the system shows:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Google AI not available, using pattern-based responses
```

This means:
- ‚úÖ Chatbot still works (pattern-based)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Google AI package may need reinstallation
- ‚úÖ No impact on user experience (automatic fallback)

### **To Fix Google AI:**

```bash
cd "/Users/sanjay/Desktop/Home Serve Pro"
source venv/bin/activate
pip uninstall google-generativeai -y
pip install google-generativeai
```

Then restart the server:
```bash
# Kill current server (Ctrl+C)
python run.py
```

---

## üìä **API Response Format**

### **Request:**
```json
POST /api/chatbot/message
Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>

{
  "message": "How do I book a service?"
}
```

### **Response (AI-powered):**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Message processed successfully",
  "data": {
    "message": "To book a service on HomeServe Pro...",
    "intent": "general",
    "quick_replies": [],
    "action": null,
    "timestamp": null,
    "ai_powered": true
  }
}
```

### **Response (Pattern-based fallback):**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Message processed successfully",
  "data": {
    "message": "I can help you book a service...",
    "intent": "create_booking",
    "quick_replies": ["Book Now", "View Services"],
    "action": "show_services",
    "timestamp": "2025-10-12T23:48:00",
    "ai_powered": false
  }
}
```
